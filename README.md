Continuous Integration and Deployment with Jenkins and GitHub
Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to set up a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using Jenkins and GitHub. The pipeline is designed to automate the process of building, testing, analyzing, and deploying an application, with email notifications for build status updates.
Pipeline Stages

The Jenkins pipeline is configured with the following stages:

    Build: Compiles and packages the code using a build automation tool.
    Unit and Integration Tests: Runs unit tests to verify code functionality and integration tests to ensure that different components of the application work together.
    Code Analysis: Analyzes the code for quality and compliance with industry standards.
    Security Scan: Scans the application for security vulnerabilities.
    Deploy to Staging: Deploys the application to a staging environment for further testing.
    Integration Tests on Staging: Executes integration tests in the staging environment.
    Deploy to Production: Deploys the final version of the application to a production environment.

Tools Used in Each Stage

    Build: Maven or another build automation tool.
    Unit and Integration Tests: JUnit or any other testing framework.
    Code Analysis: SonarQube.
    Security Scan: OWASP ZAP.
    Deployment: AWS EC2.

Email Notifications

The pipeline is configured to send email notifications after the test and security scan stages. The emails include the status of the stage (success or failure) and logs as attachments.
